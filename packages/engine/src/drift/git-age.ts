/**
 * Page age against code (N10): how long a page has been older than the newest file it references.
 *
 * Git history is an input, not something this module observes on its own. For a fixed repository, the
 * same `root`, page, and references give the same result, because every date comes from a commit and
 * nothing reads the clock (ADR 0022, rule 5). The answer is `"unknown"` rather than an error when git,
 * a work tree, or a commit for the page is missing, which is what a shallow clone or an unpacked
 * tarball looks like.
 *
 * One `git rev-parse` per root and one `git log` per path are kept in a process-wide cache, so a check
 * that asks about the same page and references again pays for neither. The cache is keyed by the
 * resolved root; a caller that changes the repository at that root after a call still sees the dates
 * from before, so pass a fresh root for a fresh history. `outputs/feed.ts` has the same repository check
 * and date lookup for its feed; the two are kept apart until a shared refactor can move both.
