/**
 * A proof record for one agent edit ([#1508], N29).
 *
 * An edit is reviewable only when the reviewer can see what the files held before it, what they
 * hold after it, and how the checks that follow an edit ended. This module writes that record as
 * one JSON file: every touched path relative to the site root (and so repository-relative when the
 * site is the repository), the SHA-256 of its bytes before and after, the doctor level (and,
 * optionally, a short projection of its findings), and a summary of the examples an edit re-ran.
 *
 * Two rules keep the record reproducible (ADR 0022, rule 5):
 *
 * - **No wall clock.** The record has no timestamp unless the caller passes `date`, or
 *   `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is set. `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is the reproducible-build convention already
 *   used by `tools/deterministic`: decimal seconds since the Unix epoch. When neither is present,
 *   the `date` field is left out. This module never calls `Date.now()`.
 * - **Fixed order.** Record keys are written in one fixed order, `files` is sorted by path
 *   comparing code points, and `examples.rerun` is sorted and has no duplicates. The same input
 *   therefore gives the same bytes.
 *
 * A file that did not exist before the edit, or does not exist after it, is represented by an
 * explicit `null` hash: `{ "path": "docs/new.md", "before": null, "after": "<hash>" }` is an added
 * file, and the reverse is a deleted one. An absent key is never guessed at; {@link createProof}
 * refuses a `files` entry missing from `before` or `after`.
 *
 * The record is written atomically: the new bytes go to a fresh folder beside the target and one
 * rename puts them in place, so a reader never sees half a record and a failed write leaves the
 * previous record untouched.
 *
 * This module knows nothing about `packages/doctor`: the doctor's report is accepted as plain
 * input ({@link ProofDoctor}), and only the fields the record keeps are copied. The record's JSON
 * Schema is exported as {@link proofSchema} so a caller or a test can validate what it wrote.
 *
 * [#1508]: https://github.com/arminazimi/slipway/issues/1508
