/**
 * One SHA-256 for a whole build, recorded in `.slipway/manifest.json` and checked by `mizzen verify` ([#1252]).
 *
 * Every file the build writes, except the manifest that records the result, is hashed; the whole-build hash is the
 * SHA-256 of one line per file (`<path>`, a NUL, the file's hash, and a line feed), with the paths sorted by code
 * point (ADR 0022, rule 5). The build and `verify` run the same rule, so both agree byte for byte.
 *
 * The manifest cannot hash itself, so it is left out: a change to the record is not a change to the build. A site
 * file that replaces the manifest makes the build leave it alone.
 *
 * [#1252]: https://github.com/arminazimi/slipway/issues/1252
