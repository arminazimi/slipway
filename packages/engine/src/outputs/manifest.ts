 * Writes `.slipway/manifest.json` into the output folder: the build's index, one entry per doc page, so doctor and the

 *
 * Each entry names the page's URL, source file, title, layout, the output files it writes, and two SHA-256 hashes: the
 * Markdown or HTML body as the model read it (`source`), and the body after Markdown became HTML (`html`). Front
 * matter is not part of either hash: the title, URL, and layout are separate fields, so a front-matter edit still
 * changes the manifest. Hashing the files themselves is `output.build-hash`'s job ([#1252]), which runs once every
 * output has written.
 *
 * Pages are sorted by URL and output paths by code point, so the same model gives the same bytes (ADR 0022, rule 5).
 * App pages are left out: they are folders of files copied as assets, not pages the engine renders, and they write no
 * output of their own. A page lists the files its enabled outputs write: the HTML file and the Markdown twin, each
 * unless `outputs` turns that output off.
