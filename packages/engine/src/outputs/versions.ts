/**
 * Writes `versions.json`: every path that lives in a documentation version folder, the versions it exists in, and the
 * URL that serves it in each, so a version switcher reads one file instead of guessing how folders map to URLs.
 *
 * The model comes from `discoverVersions` (`content/versions.ts`), with its detection rules and its version order:
 * `v1`, `v2`, `v10`, or the order a caller supplies. Pages outside every version are left out, and a site with no
 * versioned page gets no file at all, so the output adds nothing to a site that does not keep versions. A path that
 * exists in only one version still gets one entry; the version switcher then shows that version alone.
 *
 * The shape is fixed and the bytes are stable:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "pages": [
 *     {
 *       "path": "guide/install.md",
 *       "versions": [
 *         { "version": "v1", "url": "/v1/guide/install/", "status": "removed" },
 *         { "version": "v2", "url": "/v2/guide/install/" }
 *       ]
 *     }
 *   ],
 *   "byUrl": {
 *     "/v1/guide/install/": "guide/install.md",
 *     "/v2/guide/install/": "guide/install.md"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `pages` is sorted by `path` (code point) and each page's `versions` keeps `discoverVersions`' version order. A
 * version entry carries `status` only when the page is `added` in or `removed` from the newest version, so a page that
 * is unchanged omits the key. `byUrl` maps every URL back to its `path`, in code-point order, which is the lookup a
 * switcher on a rendered page needs; the URLs include `base`, like every URL in the model, while the file itself is
 * written at the output folder's root as `versions.json`. Two spaces of indentation and a final LF match the other
 * JSON outputs.
