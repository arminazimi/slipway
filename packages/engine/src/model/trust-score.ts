/**
 * Trust score (N12): one explainable level per page from its example results, its drift findings, and how
 * long ago it was reviewed.
 *
 * The model reads nothing on its own. It is a pure function of its argument, so the same input always
 * gives the same output, in the same reason order (ADR 0022, rule 5). The review age is passed in, never
 * read from the clock: the caller that has git history or a review date decides how many whole days old
 * it is, or passes `"unknown"` when it cannot tell.
 *
 * A page is `verified` only when every signal is healthy. The signals and their thresholds are:
 *
 * - **Examples.** A failing example makes a page `at-risk`: passing examples can never outweigh a
 *   failure, and no option can raise that threshold above zero, because a page whose recorded output
 *   does not run is not trustworthy. A page that declares no runnable examples is not penalized.
 * - **Drift.** Any drift finding makes a page `at-risk`. A missing drift count is not the same as zero:
 *   an unchecked page cannot be confirmed to match the code, so it is `at-risk` too.
 * - **Review age.** More than {@link DEFAULT_REVIEW_DUE_DAYS} days (180) since the last review makes a
 *   page `review-due`. An unknown age also makes it `review-due`: it cannot be shown to be fresh, but
 *   nothing is known to be wrong. The threshold is the one setting: pass
 *   `{ thresholds: { reviewDueDays } }` to change it. It is not a config key, so the frozen site config
 *   schema is untouched.
 *
 * The worst signal sets the level (`at-risk` beats `review-due` beats `verified`). Every signal still
 * contributes one reason, so a maintainer sees both what is wrong and what is fine. Reasons always come
 * in the same order: examples, then drift, then review.
 *
 * Limits: the inputs are counts and an age, not page positions, so reasons carry no source position. The
 * drift and example checks report their own findings where they occur.
