 * The answer comes from `git log --format=%cI%x02%aN --name-only` (the newest commit naming the path), so `%aN` applies the repository's `.mailmap`.
 * The date is the commit instant in UTC, so git's choice of `Z` or `+00:00` is not visible. A root outside a git work
 * tree, a file git has never seen, and a missing git all read {@link UNKNOWN}; this function never throws and never
 * reads the clock. Each root is read once per process and then cached, so a fixed repository gives the
 * same answer every time while a commit made later in the same process is not seen.
 *
 * This is a machine input: the answer depends on the repository's history and `.mailmap`, which are not part of the
 * site's source. A copy of the site without its history reports {@link UNKNOWN}; a build on a machine without git
