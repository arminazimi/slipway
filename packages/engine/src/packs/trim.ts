/**
 * Trims a set of pages to a token budget by dropping whole sections, from the least important end first.
 *
 * A page is split at its top-level headings: the lead (the title heading and the text before the
 * first section) and one section per heading, from a heading to the block before the next one.
 * The lead is the page's heading and first paragraph, and the first section is mandatory when the
 * page begins with a heading instead of a lead paragraph; a page with a single heading is all
 * lead. Mandatory content is never dropped, so a page keeps its heading and first paragraph even
 * when that alone costs more than the budget. Sections are atomic: a fenced code block is part of
 * one section and is never cut, and a `#` line inside a fence is code, not a heading.
 *
 * The budget covers the trimmed set as a whole: it is the sum of the pages' token estimates. The
 * input order is the caller's ranking, so dropping starts at the last page and its last section,
 * moves towards the first page, and stops at the first collection of mandatory content. The
 * `keep` option pins sections by id or heading text, and a pinned section can keep the output
 * above the budget; both over-budget cases are reported as diagnostics with a source position.
 *
 * When the input already fits, each page's Markdown is returned byte for byte. Otherwise the kept
 * lead and sections are joined with one blank line between them, so the output is a deterministic
 * function of the input: no disk, clock, network, or environment is read. Parsing happens through
 * {@link parseMarkdown}, so positions refer to the page's source file, starting at
 * `page.source.line`.
