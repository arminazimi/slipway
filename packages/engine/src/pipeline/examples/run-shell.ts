/**
 * Runs one shell example in a throwaway folder with a scrubbed environment ([#1462]).
 *
 * The unit is the shell counterpart of the Node example runner (N02). A caller hands it the code of a `bash` or `sh`
 * snippet and gets back what the snippet printed, its exit code, how long it took, and whether it ran inside an OS
 * sandbox. It never throws for a failing example: a non-zero exit, a timeout, or a snippet that cannot even start is a
 * result, not an exception.
 *
 * ## Isolation
 *
 * - The working folder is a fresh `mkdtemp` folder, removed when the run ends. `HOME` and `TMPDIR` point inside it.
 *   The environment is an allow-list: `PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `LANG`, and `NO_COLOR`. Everything else from the
 *   host, including secrets, is dropped. {@link RunShellOptions.env} adds variables explicitly, which is the only way
 *   to pass anything else in.
 * - Where the OS offers one, writes are confined to the working folder: `sandbox-exec` on macOS (a profile that allows
 *   everything except writes outside the folder) and `bwrap` on Linux (`/` read-only, the working folder writable).
 *   {@link ShellExampleResult.sandboxed} says whether that happened.
 *
 * ## Honesty about isolation
 *
 * Without a sandbox, the working folder and the scrubbed environment are advice, not a boundary: a snippet can still
 * `rm` a path outside the folder, read the real home directory, and reach the network. That is why the result carries
 * `sandboxed` and why the "`rm` cannot reach outside" test skips when {@link sandboxAvailable} is false. A caller that
 * needs the guarantee must check the flag; this unit never claims a guarantee it did not get.
 *
 * ## Determinism
 *
 * The result depends on the host: `PATH` and `LANG` come from the process, and the duration is wall-clock time. Both
 * are documented rather than hidden; the exit code, stdout, and stderr are whatever the snippet chose to emit.
 *
