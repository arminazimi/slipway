/**
 * A content-addressed result cache for example runners ([#1463]).
 *
 * Each example result is stored under one SHA-256 key of its code, language, kind, and runtime. The key covers the
 * inputs that change what an example does; editing any of them misses the entry and runs the example again. The
 * runtime defaults to Node's `process.version` and the engine's {@link version}, so upgrading either reruns the
 * examples too.
 *
 * One JSON file per key lives in the cache folder, `<root>/.slipway/examples` by default or the `dir` a caller names.
 * The folder is disposable: missing, unreadable, or corrupt entries are misses, and every failure here is swallowed.
 * An entry is written whole — a temporary folder then one rename — so a reader never sees half an entry and no
 * temporary file is left behind.
 *
 * Results are plain JSON objects. Wall-clock fields the runners report (`durationMs`) are removed before an entry is
 * written, so the same result always produces the same bytes; a hit returns `durationMs: 0` because no run happened.
 *
 * The cache is a build-local speed-up, not shared state: it is safe to delete at any time and needs no locking. Two
 * writers of the same key each write a complete file and the last rename wins.
 *
 * [#1463]: https://github.com/arminazimi/slipway/issues/1463
