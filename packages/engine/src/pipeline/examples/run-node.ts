/**
 * Runs one recorded Node or TypeScript example in a child process ([#1461]).
 *
 * The snippet is written into a fresh `mkdtemp` folder, beside a `package.json` for `js` and `mjs` (so both are ES
 * modules), and run by `process.execPath` with that folder as the working directory. `ts` relies on Node's native type
 * stripping, so a TypeScript example must use erasable syntax only. `HOME` and `TMPDIR` point inside the same folder,
 * and the folder is removed before {@link runNodeExample} returns, whether the example passed, failed, or timed out.
 *
 * **This is a process sandbox, not an OS sandbox.** The temp folder, the scrubbed environment, and the process group
 * limit what an example starts with. The example still runs with the same user and file permissions as the engine, so
 * it can read or write any path it names by absolute path, use the network, or leave the process group and outlive a
 * timeout. The promise is a clean start, a bounded run, and no leftover temp folder — not isolation from the host.
 * Examples come from the site being built and are treated as trusted input.
 *
 * The only ambient input is the environment, which the issue requires: `PATH` is inherited so an example that runs a
 * command works, `LANG` is fixed to `C.UTF-8` and `NO_COLOR` to `1` so output does not depend on the caller's locale or
 * terminal, and everything else in `process.env` is dropped. The duration is measured with a monotonic clock, because
 * the result reports it. No other clock or environment value is read.
 *
