/**
 * `mizzen verify <dir> [--hash <hex>]`: check a built folder against the hash its manifest recorded ([#1252]).
 *
 * The expected hash comes from `--hash` when given, otherwise from `build.hash` in `<dir>/.slipway/manifest.json`.
 * The folder is hashed by the same rule the build used, and, when the manifest carries the per-file record, the first
 * file that changed, went missing, or was added is named. Exit 0 is a match and 1 is a mismatch; a usage error is 2.
 *
 * [#1252]: https://github.com/arminazimi/slipway/issues/1252
